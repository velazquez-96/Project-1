# Kyoto Protocol - World performance analysis

For the present project, the team decided to analyze the effects of world accords on global pollution. It was found that the main expectation of the accord was to reduce at least 5% emissions for the 2008/2012 period compared to the level of emissions of 1990. Having said this, this project aims to find out if this objective was reached and how the air pollution has developed in the last years.
